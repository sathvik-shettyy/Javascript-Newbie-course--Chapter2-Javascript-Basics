//SWITCH CASE
//The "switch" statement in JavaScript is another control structure that allows you to execute a different block of code depending on a specific value. It is often used as an alternative to the "if-else ladder" when you have multiple conditions to check against a single value.

//Here is the syntax for a "switch" statement:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression == value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression == value2
    break;

  default:
  // code to be executed if expression does not match any of the values
}

//In this structure, the "expression" is evaluated and compared to each of the "case" values. If the "expression" matches a "case" value, the corresponding block of code is executed. The "break" statement is used to exit the "switch" statement and prevent the code in the following cases from being executed. The "default" case is optional and is executed if the "expression" does not match any of the "case" values.

//For example:
let x = 'apple';
switch (x) {
  case 'apple':
    console.log('x is an apple');
    break;
  case 'banana':
    console.log('x is a banana');
    break;
  case 'orange':
    console.log('x is an orange');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('x is something else');
}
//In this example, the "expression" is the variable "x," which has the value "apple." The "expression" is compared to each of the "case" values, and when it matches the value "apple," the corresponding block of code is executed and the message "x is an apple" is printed to the console.

//The "switch" statement is a useful control structure for executing different blocks of code based on a specific value. It can help you write more concise and maintainable code in JavaScript.
